tried playing around with a hybrid lstm model + qsvm for hft

well , the dataset was downloaded from hugging face , navigate there -> search for the same as in the https mentioned in notebook -> follow the .paraquet file conversion commands to load into your local systems , ideally i should have uploaded it here but i am lazy and cant upload that big of dataset ..
